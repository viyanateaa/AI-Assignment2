How to test Your solution to Assignment 2

There are two sets of face/facit files in this archive:

training-A.txt       contains the first 200 faces from training.txt
facit-A.txt          contains the corresponding facit values

test-B.txt           contains the last 100 faces from training.txt
facit-B.txt          contains the corresponing facit values

run your program like this (Java example):

java Faces training-A.txt facit-A.txt test-B.txt > result.txt

and then run the 'grading' program, which tests your results against the facit:

java FaceTest facit-B.txt result.txt

The program will output the percentage of correct classifications.
